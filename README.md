# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This project is a comparative analysis / study of different classification algorithms in Machine Learning for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease. (Kidney Failure)

The dataset is taken from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease

The Classification Techniques used are:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier
Naive Bayes
SGD Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

The minimum accuracy is 96% and maximum is 100%.

All the analysis, model building, training and testing is in 'CKD-main.ipynb' file in the 'project' folder and the application is in 'ckd-web-app' folder.
